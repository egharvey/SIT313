    <h5>Content</h5>
    <p>Web technologies are used to underpin many modern 
        software applications, and understanding how to build client 
        and server side programs is an integral part of building these applications. 
        This unit is part of the application development major, and explores the development of web applications using the latest standards. The learning experiences in this unit will help students understand how to build both 
        the client and server side software needed to drive modern applications. Students will expand their abilities in both web development and database knowledge and skills gained in earlier units by learning how to utilise client-server programming languages to create small data-driven web applications.
